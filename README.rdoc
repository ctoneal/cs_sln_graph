= cs_sln_graph

cs_sln_graph is a small utility gem I wrote to generate dependency graphs for C# solution files using GraphViz.

You will need to install GraphViz before using this gem.

== Usage

To install, use gem
	
	% gem install cs_sln_graph
	
The -i argument specifies the path to your solution. 

The -o argument specifies the path to your output file (it will default to the directory your solution is in).

-f specifies the format the output file should be in (default is png).
